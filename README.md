# Recipes
A project to create the basic layout for recipes. This is mostly to practice building html sites without Javascript frameworks. 

Interesting things I learned:
-I've never really understood why we place the encoding information in the head. I got to mess around with that a bit, and learned at least one scenario where it is important.
-Because this was a simple HTML project, there wasn't much more to learn, but it was fun to do it as a refresher. 
-Most of the time I've worked with Git, it's been through GUIs. It was nice to work with it more in the console.
